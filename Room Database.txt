 CHECK ALSO; Database (for basic intro)

  ------ ALTERNATIVE TO SQLITE IN ANDROID IS ROOM DATABASE ----
- Room database is a new concept for creating a database in android applications introduced in 2017
- Room database creates an Abstract Layer above the SQLite Database.
- It is preferred over sqlite to ensure data persistency.


 The room database has 3 main components, ie
 1- Entity: It represents the data in a single row of the table in the database. It is simply a table
 2- DAO (Data Access Object): It is a method that is used to access the database
 3- Database: It is a class that holds entities and the database versions.

--- Room Database Transactions ---
Create Database
Create Table
Add New Data (Insert)
Show/retrieve Data in App (Query)
Data Update (Update)
Data Delete (Delete)

====== Architectural Room Database ========
 Room database does not work alone, it works with auxiliary components known as "Architectural Components".
 Room applications and architectural components will come together to develop android applications.

-The purpose of Architectural Components is to guide the issues such as; management of the application's lifecycle, as well as data persistency while creating the application's architecture.
These architectural components offers to develope stronger, more sustainable, as well as testable applications.

 They are 3 components that make up the architectural components, and they are;
1. RoomDatabase
2. ViewModel
3. Repository
 
- A ViewModel is a class that is used to store and manage data to be displayed in the User Interface.
- The viewModel concept ensures that data is not lost and is maintained in configuration change situations such as screen rotation or language change.
- ViewModel acts as a bridge between data and the user interface such as an activity or fragment. Between the repository and the UI.

==== LiveData ====
- This constantly monitors changes in the livedata database and reflects it instantly in components such as activities.
In other words, it performs the task of forwarding the changes in the database live


==== Repository ====
- This manages data exchanges between component databases, ie between local databases or online (known as REST APIs).
