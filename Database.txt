CHECK ALSO: Room Database.

- Database is a digital place where information is categoriszed and stored.
- You can view a database as an Excel sheet, except we use a query systment in a database known as SQL(Structured Query Language).
- You can access a database from anywhere within an application.


====== SQLite Database ========
It is an Open Source Database
It stores data in a text file.
It comes ready to use on android
It is a standard relational database. ie data is stored in rows-columns in tables.
Structured tables are known as schema.

--- Disadvantages: ----
  1. Lots of lines of code to convert between Java Object and SQL Query
  2. Errors are not shown during compilation, noticed only during running the application.


  ------ ALTERNATIVE TO SQLITE IN ANDROID IS ROOM DATABASE ----
- Room database is a new concept for creating a database in android applications introduced in 2017
- Room database creates an Abstract Layer above the SQLite Database.
- It is preferred over sqlite to ensure data persistency.
