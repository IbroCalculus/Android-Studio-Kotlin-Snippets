- Model contains data and business logic

- View is the display layer, it is composed of the activities, fragments, layouts etc

- ViewModel manages lifecycle, connects the other two components, it sits between the View and the Model. It provides lifecycle management and data availability.
It takes data from the Model and allows the View to display the data

 --- LiveData (MutableLiveData) - implements the observable pattern that is used in the mvvm architecture.
