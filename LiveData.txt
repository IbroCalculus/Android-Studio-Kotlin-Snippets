CHECK: ViewModel and LiveData

LiveData is an observable data holder or class.
It handles update to data being passed to it, hence, anything observing the LiveData will get dynamic updates.

NB:
- An observable class is a class that can be observed, while an observer is a class that observes something.
- MutableLiveData is an updateable LiveData class.


============== Advantage of LiveData ============
- Ensures UI matches data state
- No memory leaks
- No crashes due to stopped activities
- Automatic lifecycle handling
- Always up to date
- Handles config changes
- Resource sharing
