- A service is a component that operates in the background without requiring direct user input.

- Services are used for processes that are repeated and may take a long time to complete.

- Services have a greater priority than idle or invisble activity.

-A Service is an application component that can perform long-running operations in the background.
-Services do not provide a user interface.
-Another application componenet can start a service. E.g button.
 ie; clicking a button calls a service to begin downloading a file in the background.
 Music player playing in the background
 Sending data to a server in the backgroun. etc.

========== Types of Android Services ===========
1. Foreground Services:
   The user need to see the process. Eg, downloading a file in the background, and seeing the progress or notification

2. Background Services:
   The user does not even see the process. No notification or progress indicator. E.g a program that compresses photos in the background.

3. Bound Services:
   It is dependent on the component that calls itself. 
   The service interacts with the component permamently that calls itself.
   when a component that calls itself stops, the service also stops, so service does not continue to work in the background.
   The relationship is called client-server relation. Where the server is the service, and the client is a component that starts the service.

   Music player application can be an example of bound services.


 Traditionally, there are 2 service classes:
1. Service Classes: Good for small tasks.
2. Job Intent Service Classes: Create a separate working thread, faster. For long term background processes.
