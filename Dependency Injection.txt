Dependency injection is a design pattern (NOT specfic to only android development) that can be applied to any software development language
2 popular libraries used for implementing depency injections are Dagger (then Dagger2) and Hilt.

Hilt is newer. Dagger (Dagger2) is more complex than Hilt. Hilt is much easier to learn and implement.
It can be used both in Java and Kotlin.
